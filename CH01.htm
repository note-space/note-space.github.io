<div class='comment' style='max-width: 700px' >It's hard to believe,
but it has been twenty years since Charlie died -- it was February 7th, 1993.
 He would have been 56 this year, on May 21st, 2013.
 I think if he knew how much he lives on in our lives, our hearts and our memories, it would make him happy.
 This page is here for anyone who knew Charlie to put up memories, tell our children stories,
 talk about how Charlie affected our lives, or just remember him.
 If you know someone we might have lost touch with, feel free to forward the link.<br>
 It would be more fun if Charlie were still here ... Nancy <br></div><br>

<div class='displayT' >When I knew Charlie in his last years, he was making hats. <br><br>&#34;Hats&#34; does not do justice to the creations. They were sewed or constructed in such complex ways that three dimensions could barely contain them.<br><br>I think at the time he was hospitalized. Nurses saw him working on his hats from his hospital bed, and bought hats from him right out of the bed. That was the way people responded to these works.  I have a complicated quilted sheath in mustard yellow which, when I saw, I HAD TO HAVE. <br><br>There is so much more to him, and I did not know him for very long, but I thought the hats should be mentioned.</div>

<div class='displayT' >I have many happy - exciting - memories of Charlie.  Climbing trees, Troop 69 parties, and memories of how he would encourage me to get into debates, okay, arguments when having dinner at &#34;the house.&#34;  I still have christmas ornaments that he made, and a pair of fabulous blue cloth earrings.  He loved riding on the back of my motorcycle and he glued animal fur, I think it was fox, onto the bike&#39;s gas tank.  His laugh, the way he danced  in to a room, his passion for food, zest for the provocative were Charlie.  Pretending to make out with each other, and mushrooms.  The last time I saw Charlie I was visiting SF from LA.  He said he was going to a near by restaurant. I asked what restaurant, he said, &#34;Spa-ah-getz&#34;.  He was trying to gain weight and said he could eat all he wanted of white.  I miss his smile, his laugh and am grateful for the expanse he created within my heart</div>

<div class='displayT' >(re: the videos)<br>Wonderful. Wonderful.  I am glad the technology was there to capture these moments.  His penultimate Christmas at 251 included a memorable jam session with percussion only--instrumental and vocal.  His organic energy was so much a part of who he was.  If a family is the sum of its parts, we are a little less without Charlie. (Feb 7, 2013)</div>

<div class='displayT' >Thank you so much for these videos.  I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to me, who never got to meet Charlie, to see him in action.  He was so talented.  Early deaths are very sad--we&#39;ll never know how our relationships with Charlie would have developed, and what he would have up his sleeve for the future.  I&#39;m sure it would have been creative, lively, and fun.<br><br>All my best to all of you on this, the 20th anniversary of Charlie&#39;s death.  I&#39;m thinking of him, and of all of you.

<div class='displayT' >re the videos<br>...I especially like the &#34;high school&#34; dance sequence (2 takes) and how fluidly he moves, and the &#34;Temple Whores&#34; music. At the end of the TW clip there is a short clip of Charlie and his close friend James dancing in a fashion show - the costumes are Charlie&#39;s - I love this short clip ...</div>

<div class='displayT' >So I just watched the Temple Whores and I can&#39;t help but think how our music making has been diminished by Charlie&#39;s loss. We would all sound better if he were here. As much as I harassed him I now am reminded of how and why I loved that boy. What a wonderful gift lost. Thank you David C for sharing this. (Feb 8, 2013)</div>

<div class='displayT' >Nancy and Tom....and Everyone,<br>Yes! I have thought of Charlie so very many times and he has visited my dreams, too, but always in too fleeting a way. Some memories, a little random: I was in Charlie&#39;s high school posse with Nancy and Tom and Mary and Chuck and Sue and Mark and, and, and and. Even then, and most certainly before, Charlie was the most unflappable and giddily happy person I&#39;d ever met in my life. (&#34;I have no guilt,&#34; he would explain many years later.) He always had his flute with him, I think maybe especially in college, and would bring it out at the slightest provocation. He had music in him like I&#39;d never seen. I think it burned in him and just had to come out. Once we made an &#34;absurdist&#34; movie for a high school English project. The movie consisted of the two of us &#34;at table&#34; eating breakfast. He was pouring milk into my cereal bowl. He kept pouring and pouring and pouring until milk overflowed the bowl, spread out across the white tablecloth, and dripped onto the Hallorans&#39; floor.  The End. We thought it was just the greatest thing in the world but it was met with silence by our classmates. Whatever. I remember the summer when Charlie returned from traveling in Europe and Morocco, picking oranges, living in a cave by the sea. You what? You can do that? Yes, George, you can. And more. After Charlie moved to the West Coast, I visited a bunch of times. He had new friends, with Nancy almost always his closest, yes? You guys always, always, always made me feel welcome. I love you forever for that. It was a time of deep change for me but I marveled, really marveled at how Charlie and Nancy, Chuck too, just made these new lives for themselves. Just. Up. And. Did. It. Charlie was for the most part just very comfortable in his self, un-toppled by the whirlwind. Today I found some pictures of Charlie from the late 70s, maybe. He&#39;s wearing a red flannel shirt and big ol&#39; spectacles. He&#39;s on a porch roof somewhere smiling nice, then down like a cat, and then on his back with a leg up, stepping into the air. See you later, Charlie. And thank you, Nancy and Tom for putting this site together. (Pictures linked below.)</div>

<div class='displayT' >After reading your email about this page, and seeing a photo of Charlie, I had a dream about him last night. We were in a tunnel that had streetcars going through it. As each car passed, a figure at the car stop would be lit up by the headlights - first a woman with a bright red hat, then man in a snazzy suit. Charlie and I went up to the top of the tunnel, which was a steep hill, and then he took his clothes off and threw himself onto the tracks, which had turned into a giant slide. He slid down the hill, getting thinner and thinner til he reached the bottom. I picked him up like a child and wrapped him in a cloth.<br><br>The years pass but the power of myth and symbolism that Charlie tapped into, still holds me enthralled. He lives on in our subconscious. He will never be forgotten.</div>
<a href='#' onclick='s_one(8)' class='link2' >Leah</a><br><br>
<div class='displayT' >I have a large gray pillow that Charlie made me that I lay on every day when I&#39;m reading in bed.  I think of him often.  I really can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s been 20 years.  Or that I turned 60 this year.</div>

<div class='displayT' >Charlie appears regularly in my dreams - he is well but I know he is leaving us. Such a feeling of emptiness. Charlie was so kind and patient and nurturing to me. His presence in my life was truly a blessing. Love you, Charlie, sweet angel.</div>

<div class='displayT' >I remember sitting with Charlie in a high school classroom, reading through a play, and he told me my aura was really noticeable .. hey, it was the 70&#39;s.<br>I think I remember him often drawing a sharp breath before launching into an enthusiastic description of something, like a theatrical gasp, maybe with a finger-snap added, if he didn&#39;t have your full attention yet.   And maybe a little look of veiled disappointment if you weren&#39;t keeping up with him, but too good-natured to say a word about that.</div>
